The purpose of the Classic e-Library is to provide Scripturally sound material for free by means of the Internet.

In the first place, it is our conviction that the Lord truly dispenses His “glorious riches” (Eph. 3:16) to His church. How great and how high and how deep is the life with God! For us to notice it and to live according to it is the work of the Holy Spirit, but at the same time it is something for which the Holy Spirit uses all the saints (Eph. 3:18). Through the ages, it has remained the prerogative and the task of all the saints worldwide to examine and express these “glorious riches”.

We are online based Library.Our aim is to allow other people in third-world situations to participate in the exploration and expression of this great wealth. 

We pray therefore that everyone involved (authors, publishers, readers – saints!) may participate and enjoy the great gift of grace that God has given us in Christ to the glory of our Triune God.

    We would rather not call it a vision, as we want to place this project completely under the provision of the Lord. However, it is our deep conviction that we may undertake this project with great expectation in the Triune God. With His blessing, we hope and pray that we might soon be able to make thousands of books and articles available. Our God is mighty to rouse other saints to enthusiasm about the possibility of making His “glorious riches” available, freely and for free, to everyone who wants to delight in it to the glory of our God.
